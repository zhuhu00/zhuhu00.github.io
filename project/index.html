    <p><strong>My role:</strong> Full developer</p>
    <p>
     VeReS is an vehicle retrieval system particularly for Vehicle search. The system can be used to find the same car or car re-identification. The feature model is learned by metric learning, and detection is applied before feature is extracted in the boundingbox, Developing the system is just for interest in my free time. Opinions are solely my own.
